Acrobat's \nimage-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to \nperformance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools \nbefore adding them to PDF documents. \nIf the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. \nTo maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed \nthem within the PDF. \nYou can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding \nalternative text for images and proper content tagging. \nRefer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects \nin a PDF using Acrobat. \n \nAdd images in a PDF \n1. Open the PDF in Acrobat. Select Edit a PDF from the All tools menu and then \nselect Image. \n2. From the drop-down menu, select Choose image to select an image from your device \nor Select Generate image to generate an image from text. \n \nNote:  \nTo learn how to generate images from text, go to Generate unique AI images from text."

When internet access is later available, anyone \nvalidating the signature can add timestamping and revocation information to the PDF. \nSubsequent signature validations can also make use of this information. \nTo add verification information after signing: \n1. Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and \nthen right-click the signature in the PDF. \n2. Select Add Verification Information. \nInformation and methods used to include this long-term validation (LTV) information in the \nPDF comply with Part 4 of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) \nstandard. \nThe command is unavailable if the signature is invalid, or is signed with a self-signed \ncertificate.

You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. \n \nWhat is a digital signature? \nDigital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate \ndocuments, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign \ndocuments quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. \n \nWhy validate a digital signature? \nWhen you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the \nsigner and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, \nvalidation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the \nauthenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. \nTo verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are \ntrusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or \nAcrobat Reader settings. \nTo verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after \nsigning.

This feature analyzes the \ndocument for content that may alter the look and feel of the document and suppresses such \ncontent to allow you to view and sign the document in a static and secure state. \nBy signing in preview mode, you can find if the document contains: \n• \nAny dynamic content or external dependencies. \n• \nAny constructs such as form fields, multimedia, or JavaScript™ that may affect its look \nand feel.  \nAfter reviewing the report, you can contact the author of the document about the problems \nlisted in the report. \n \nCertify a PDF \nCertifying a PDF means approving its contents and specifying what changes are allowed for \nthe document to remain certified. For example, a government agency creates a form with \nsignature fields and certifies it, allowing users to only change form fields and sign the \ndocument. Removing pages or adding comments will result in losing the certified status. \nA certifying signature can only be applied if the PDF has no other signatures. These signatures \ncan be visible or invisible, and a blue ribbon icon  \n in the Signatures panel confirms a valid \ncertifying signature. Adding a certifying digital signature requires a digital ID. \n \nTimestamp a document \nAcrobat allows users to add a document timestamp to a PDF without needing an identity-\nbased signature. To timestamp a PDF, a timestamp server is needed. See how to configure a \ntimestamp server. \nA timestamp guarantees the authenticity and existence of a document at a specific time and \ncomplies with ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard.  \n \nValidate a digital signature"
